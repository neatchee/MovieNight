# HLS Implementation Optimization

This document explains the optimizations made to the HLS implementation compared to PR #3.

## Architecture Comparison

### PR #3 Implementation (Complex)
- **Segments**: Time-based segment simulation with sliding windows
- **Dependencies**: External `hls-m3u8` library for playlist management
- **Endpoints**: Multiple dynamic segment endpoints (`/live_segment_X.ts`)
- **State Management**: Complex segment windows and sequence tracking
- **Playlist Generation**: Dynamic M3U8 creation with library calls

### Optimized Implementation (Simple)
- **Streaming**: Direct live stream conversion to TS format
- **Dependencies**: Pure Go implementation, no external HLS libraries
- **Endpoints**: Simple static endpoints (`/live.m3u8`, `/live.ts`)
- **State Management**: Minimal state tracking for active streams
- **Playlist Generation**: Static M3U8 template pointing to live stream

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced Latency**: Direct streaming eliminates segment buffering delays
2. **Lower Memory Usage**: No segment window management or buffering
3. **Simpler Debugging**: Cleaner code paths and fewer moving parts
4. **Better Reliability**: Enhanced panic recovery and error handling
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer dependencies and simpler architecture

## Compatibility

- **iOS Safari**: Native HLS support via `/live.m3u8` â†’ `/live.ts`
- **Desktop Browsers**: Primary MPEG-TS via `/live` with HLS fallback
- **Error Recovery**: Simplified but robust fallback mechanisms
- **Existing Features**: All existing functionality preserved

## Testing

Run benchmarks to see performance improvements:

```bash
go test -bench=BenchmarkHLS.*
```

The simplified implementation maintains full iOS compatibility while significantly reducing complexity and improving performance.
